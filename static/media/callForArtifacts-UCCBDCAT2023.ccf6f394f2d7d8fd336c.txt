# UCC/BDCAT’23 Call for Artifacts

## Overview

As reproducibility and availability of artifacts -or lack thereof- affect 
the impact and visibility of a paper, computer science conferences are 
putting in place artifact evaluation tracks.

An artifact of a paper is an element that extends beyond the document itself, 
this can be software, datasets, environment configuration, workflow 
definition, hardware, benchmarks, scripts to run experiments.

Based on the success and experience of artifact evaluation for similar 
conferences, this year UCC/BDCAT 2023 will evaluate artifacts in a more 
standardized way than previous years. In particular, the process will be 
single-blinded, it will use a special track using Microsoft CMT and a timeline 
will need to be respected by both the authors and the evaluation committee.

Although the artifacts will be evaluated after acceptance notification, we 
encourage all interested authors to prepare and register artifacts well in 
advance.

## Artifact Evaluation Organization and Evaluation

The goal of the artifact evaluation track is to award badges to accepted papers. 
These badges will be based on the [NISO Reproducibility Badging and Definitions 
Standard]( https://www.niso.org/publications/rp-31-2021-badging) and the [ACM 
Reproducibility Standard]( https://www.acm.org/publications/artifacts).

The badges available are (in an incremental inclusive order) Artifacts Available, 
Artifacts Evaluated-Functional and Results Replicated. Authors should choose the 
desired badge based on the maturity and expected reproducibility of their work.

All papers submitted to UCC/BDCAT 2023 are encouraged to submit an Artifact 
Description using a form to be provided). For evaluating the reproducibility of 
the experiments, a complete description of the experiment workflow will be asked, 
together with an estimation of the execution time and a description of the expected 
results.

The Artifact Description documentation should include version-controlled software 
and data repositories such as Zenodo, FigShare, Dryad, GitHub, GitLab. Authors 
should consider providing the most suitable packaging for the paper’s artifact, 
this could be: source code, container/VM, binary installer, live web deployment, 
access to special hardware or cloud services (with security precautions concerning 
access by the reviewer).

A single-blinded evaluation will be done, and the committee will validate and 
evaluate the completion of the form as well as the artifact accessibility.
