                    The digital transformation of all areas of life is accelerated in this century by novel Cloud-Edge Continuum services, infrastructures, data platforms and cyber-physical systems. This broader scope of computing calls for technically sound contributions that combine scale with convenience and reliability. Indeed, society and economy depend on Cloud-Edge Continuum applications, delivering computing on demand in every location as a general service to the public, in analogy to conventional utilities. The engineering of such systems and applications calls for scientifically proven approaches, methods, tools and technologies.

                    The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC) is a premier annual conference series aiming to provide a platform for researchers from both academia and industry to present new discoveries in the broad area of Cloud and Edge utility computing and applications. Previous events were held in Shanghai, China  (Cloud 2009), Melbourne, Australia (Cloud 2010 & UCC 2011), Chennai, India (UCC 2010), Chicago, USA (UCC 2012), Dresden, Germany (UCC2013), London, UK (UCC 2014), Limassol, Cyprus (UCC 2015), Shanghai, China (UCC 2016), Austin, USA (UCC 2017), Zurich, Switzerland  (UCC 2018), Aucland, New Zealand (UCC 2019), Leicester, UK (UCC 2020), Leicester, UK (UCC 2021), and Vancouver, USA (UCC 2022). UCC 2023 will be held in conjunction with the 10th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications and Technologies (BDCAT 2023) in Taormina, Messina, Italy.

                <h2>PAPER SUBMISSION</h2>
                <p>Authors are invited to submit papers electronically through the following link: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/UCCBDCAT2023">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/UCCBDCAT2023</a>.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Submitted manuscripts must represent original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other conference or journal.
Manuscripts are submitted in PDF format and may not exceed ten (10) ACM-formatted *double-column* pages, including figures, tables, and references. All manuscripts undergo a double-blind peer-review process and will be reviewed and judged on correctness, originality,technical strength, rigour in analysis, quality of results, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference attendees. Your submission is subject to a determination that you are not under any sanctions by ACM. Accepted papers will later be converted into single-column format through the ACM TAPS process and therefore need to use the new templates that are single-column by default. Switch them to double-column for authoring your paper. This is possible in both the Word and the LaTeX templates.
                    <br/><br/>
                    At least one author of each paper must be registered for the conference in order for the paper to be published in the proceedings. The conference proceedings will be published by the ACM and made available online via the IEEE Xplore Digital Library and ACM Digital Library.
