        <h2>Manuscript Guideline and Submission</h2>
        <p>
          Authors are invited to submit posters electronically. Submitted paper
          writeups should be structured as technical papers and submitted in PDF
          format. Papers may not exceed two (2) ACM-formatted double-column
          pages, including figures, tables, and references. All manuscripts will
          be reviewed and judged on correctness, originality,technical strength,
          rigour in analysis, quality of results, quality of presentation, and
          interest and relevance to the conference attendees. Your submission is
          subject to a determination that you are not under any sanctions by
          ACM. Accepted posters will later be converted into single-column
          format through the ACM TAPS process and therefore need to use the new
          templates that are single-column by default. Switch them to
          double-column for authoring your paper. This is possible in both the
          Word and the LaTeX templates.

          conference theme, technical strength, rigour in analysis, quality of
          results, organization and clarity of presentation of the paper.

          Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research that is
