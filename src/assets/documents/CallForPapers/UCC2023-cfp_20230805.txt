======================================================

The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and
Cloud Computing (UCC) is a premier annual conference
series aiming to provide a platform for researchers
from both academia and industry to present new
discoveries in the broad area of Cloud, Edge and
Computing Continuum utility computing and applications.
The conference features keynotes, posters, workshops and
a student symposium. UCC 2023 will be held in
conjunction with the 10th IEEE/ACM International
Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications and
Technologies (BDCAT 2023).

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished
research manuscripts in all areas of Cloud-Edge
Continuum for utility computing and related computing
paradigms such as Serverless, Distributed Computing and
Function as a Service. Topics of interest include (but
not limited to):
 - Resource Management for Cloud-Edge Continuum:
    Principles and Theoretical Foundations of Utility
    Computing; Architectural Models and Patterns to
    Achieve Utility; Virtualization, Containerization,
    Composition and Orchestration; Formal and
    Qualitative Aspects; Middleware and Stacks;
    Networking and Network Management; Saas, Paas, Iaas
    and XaaS; Resource Management and Scalability:
    Brokering, Scheduling, Capacity planning and
    Elasticity; Security, Trust, Privacy, Policies and
    Blockchains; Autonomic, Adaptive, Self-*, SLAs,
    Management and Monitoring; Designs and Deployment
    Models: Private, Public, Hybrid, Federated,
    Aggregated, Inter-Cloud; High Performance Computing
    (HPC); Performance Analysis and Modeling.
 - Artificial Intelligence for Cloud-Edge Continuum:
    Machine Learning Operations (MLOps); Artificial
    Intelligence Solutions for Scheduling, Provisioning
    and Deployment; Artificial Intelligence Solutions
    for Orchestration; GPU as a Service (GPUaaS),
    Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS);
    Support for Extract/Transform/Load (ETL) or ETL
    Pipelines; Machine Learning Cloud Frameworks;
    Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure; Distributed,
    Federated, and Collaborative Learning.
 - Applications and Systems for Cloud-Edge Continuum:
    Native Application Design, Programming Models and
    Engineering; Serverless and Function-Based
    Applications (FaaS); Microservices Architectures
    Quantum Computing; Interfacing to Internet of Things
    (IoT) Applications; Utility-Driven Models and
    Mechanisms in All Domains (e.g., Smart Cities,
    Mobility, Healthcare, Industry 4.0); Micro Data
    Centers; Interfacing to Mobile Devices: Management,
    Hierarchy Models and Business Models;
    Energy-Efficiency and Sustainability; Development
    Operations (DevOps); Economic and Business Models;
    Business and Legal Implications Beyond Technology.

>> PAPER SUBMISSION
Authors are invited to submit papers electronically
through the following link:
https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/UCCBDCAT2023

Submitted manuscripts must represent original
unpublished research that is not currently under review
for any other conference or journal. Manuscripts are
submitted in PDF format and may not exceed ten (10)
ACM-formatted *double-column* pages, including figures,
tables, and references. All manuscripts undergo a 
double-blind peer-review process and will be reviewed 
and judged on correctness, originality, technical
strength, rigor in analysis, quality of results, quality
of presentation, and interest and relevance to the
conference attendees. Your submission is subject to a
determination that you are not under any sanctions by
ACM.

At least one author of each paper must be registered for
the conference in order for the paper to be published in
the proceedings. The conference proceedings will be
published by the ACM and made available online via the
IEEE Xplore Digital Library and ACM Digital Library.
